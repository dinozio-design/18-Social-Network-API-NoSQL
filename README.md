# 18 - Social Network API - NoSQL

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-lightblue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description
MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. Over the last part of this course. In this week's Challenge I use several of the technologies that social networking platforms use in their full-stack applications. Because the foundation of these applications is data, it is pragmatic to understand how to build and structure the API first.

I built an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. I use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) and [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) packages, I also optionally use a JavaScript date library of your choice or the native JavaScript `Date` object to format timestamps.
